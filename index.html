          <h2>2014 U.S. State Data Demonstrates Relationship Between Health Markers<br> and Poverty Levels</br></h2>

          <p><strong>Experience interactive visulizations </strong>of different views by selecting various headings of
            Poverty, Age, Household Income, Obesity, Smokers, and Healthcare percentages. Each selection shifts the
            State data represented in circles on the graph. The circles can then be hovered over to view specific
            values for that individual state.  </p>

          <p>Median household income in the United States in 2014 was $53,657, not statistically different in real terms
            from the 2013 median income. This is the third consecutive year that the annual change was not statistically
            significant, following two consecutive annual declines.</p>

          <p>The percentage of people without health insurance coverage for the entire 2014 calendar year was 10.4 percent,
             down from 13.3 percent in 2013. The number of people without health insurance declined to 33.0 million from
              41.8 million over the period.   </p>

          <p>The poverty rate for families and the number of families in poverty were 11.6 percent and 9.5 million in
             2014, neither statistically different from the 2013 estimates.</p>

          <p>The Current Population Survey shows that the percentage of people with health insurance for all or part
             of 2014 was 89.6 percent, higher than the rate in 2013 (86.7 percent).</p>

           <p>Between 2013 and 2014, the greatest changes in coverage rates were the increases in direct-purchase health
              insurance and Medicaid. The largest percentage-point change in coverage was for direct-purchase, which
              increased by 3.2 percentage points to cover 14.6 percent of people for some or all of 2014. The percentage
              of people with Medicaid coverage during all or part of the year increased by 2.0 percentage points to 19.5
              percent in 2014.</p>

           <p>The Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement is subject to sampling and nonsampling
              errors. All comparisons made in the report have been tested and found to be statistically significant at the
              90 percent confidence level, unless otherwise noted. </p>
